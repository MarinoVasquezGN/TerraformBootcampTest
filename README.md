# Writing Good Documentation
## Terraform Bootcamp - Using Codeblocks

Example of good documentation, *use **codeblocks** whenever possible*

Adding the language to the beggining of the code block will color code the code.
```python
print('This is a code block')
```

Code block for console errors:
```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
```
